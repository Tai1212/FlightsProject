## General Info
This project investigates whether it is possible to predict cheap flights by analyzing flight data and identifying the various attributes that impact the cost of a flight. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to build accurate models that can forecast flight prices based on these attributes. This projects utilizes many techniques, such as:
* Data Driven Insights: Analyzing flight data to extract meaningful trends and correlations.
* Feature Engineering: Transforming raw flight information into features relevent to price prediction.
* AI-Powered Predictions: Using advanced machine learning models to predict flight costs with accuracy.
* Automation with Selenium: Automated a system that simulates a person selecting their desired flight to fetch data directly from expedia.com, streamlining the data collection process.

This project combines data analysis, machine learning, andweb automation to deliver a robust solution for forecasting flight prices. It demonstrates a strong understanding of end-to-end AI model development, from data collection to prediction, making it applicable to real-world scenarios in travel and e-commerce. 

## Features
1. Crawling and Scraping:
   * Automated a system using Selenium to simulate a user selecting flights and extracting real-time data directly from websites.
   * Ensured efficient and accurate scrapng of flight-related data, forming the basis for downstream analysis.
2. Data Loading:
   * Loading raw flight data from an Excel file (flight_data.xlsx)
